## Intoduction
*Hi I am Husam Zabian a computer engineer student and i am very excited to learn python*

## Reading Summary


**I have been intrested about the developer mid set**

### Some Main points to be taken
- Conceiving The Purpose of Software
- Simplicity
- Complexity
- Consistency
- Prioritizing
- Self-Development

**let us find what I have been figured out in each point**


## Conceiving The Purpose of Software
*I've figured out that the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are, and Developers who cannot conceive the purpose of the software will write bad software*

## Simplicity
*I've figured out how the developer have to be simple and comfortable to the user even if you are an intellegent and there is up-levels between user and the developers at the end of the program the users will try the software program and it should be simple to feel satisfied by them thats the difference between good and bad developers*

## Complexity
*it's the opposite of Simplicity but in this section they are not comparing with Simplicity! just we have to that each developer will start like an easy simple short project then it become more huge and hard even when you are fixing a little things you will see that became much harder because the level that you have reached. I prefer to say about that part :- Easy to learn,Hard to Master*
## Consistency
*I've found out that this part is like an integration for the Simplicity part , so if you are using for example a contstant way to define variables it will make more easier for you and for the other developers to read your code and find if there is any bug to be fixed. we can say that it's a huge factor of Simplicity by being Consistent*
## Prioritizing
*I am amused by the equation that i have discoverd and it is helping us about how to make decision*

### The equation of Prioritizing
**D=V/E**

- D:The desirability of a change
- V:The value of a change
- E:The effort required to perform the change

## Self-Development
*I beleive this point that have a huge factor to be a successfull developer, each developer should learn every day somthething new because every time we are hearning about new technologies and we must to deal with them ,maybe the old technologies and methods will not be requested after the new technologies is relased and this skill must be tought by your own not by someone telling you that!*
